The data set that was "cleaned" for this project was dowloaded from the Official Webiste of New York City (http://www1.nyc.gov/home/search/index.page?search-terms=Rolling+sales+update). The data set assigned to this project was specifically the one named Rolling_Queens.xls, which then was converted into .csv.

Using this data set, we focused on the following variables:
1. sale.price, which after deleting the values that were not digits and coercing it from a Factor to a numeric type became sale.price.n
2. gross.square.feet, which was also corced from a Factor to a numeric type.
3. land.square.feet, also coerced from a Factor to a numeric type.
4. year.built, which was coerced from an integer to a numeric type.
5. building.class.category, which became bk.homes

The coercions taken place from Factor to numeric were done in order to manipulate data more efficiently.

No NA values were removed from either variable. 

For variables such as sale.price.n, only actual sales different from zero were considered. 

Files
Graphical representation of the data is represented in plots, whether regular plot, log base 10 plot or log plots.

The goals of this assignment are:
a) to understand the basic principles of tidying a data set using R programming and RStudio
b) To understand the principles of reproducible research by: 

  a) Creating an RStudio project that will be "pushed" to a git repository containing:
1. README file
2. Conclusion.Rmd

3. A Data directory:
          -rollingsales_queens.csv
  -gatherRS.R (Containing code to clean the data set rollingsales_queens.csv)
  -gatherbksale2.R (Containing the clean created data frame bk.sale)
  -gatherbkhomes.R (Containing steps and clean created data frame bk.homes)
  -Makefile.R

4. An Analysis directory:
  -analysis.R (Containing the codes for plotting both data frames bk.sales and bk.homes)

5. A Paper directory:
  -Conclusion.html (Displaying the results and plots from Conclusion.Rmd)
